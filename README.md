## üîñ To-do:
- The external API does not provide a query string search options. Until this feature is not implemented, the front-end use memoization to process query search and pagination.
- The external API accepts any number as param when accessing the product page. When accessing with an non-existent id is returned the last product added. By adding an string ID an properly 404 page is shown.
- Create tests using Vitest and React Testing Library.
